	<p>Opera Dragonfly contains a fully-featured JavaScript Debugger. This is accessible from the Scripts panel in the main application toolbar. The JavaScript Debugger enables the state of the webpage or application to be inspected by setting break points to control the flow of the program as the code is stepped through. The debugger supports breaking on user-defined events and tracking of program state, including variable and object values. This makes it easier to identify bugs in the application and understand exactly what is happening at any given stage.</p>
